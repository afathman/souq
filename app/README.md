Souq Setup Guide
---------------

Getting setup for Souq involves two aspects:

  - _**Preferred Node**_ - [Installation & Configuration](http://)
  - _**Mobile App**_ - [Installation & Configuration](http://)

Use the links to learn more on how to setup either/both.

In short, once configured and installed, the _Mobile App_ synchronizes with your _Preferred Node_, enabling you to interface with the underlying Blockchain.

If you don't use a service provider for your _Preferred Node_, then you must host your own.

The _Mobile App_ requires a _Preferred Node_ in order to fully function.
